# hcm-neutral-upload-adapters

Purpose
This repository defines the Neutral Upload Adapter Layer within the HCM economic field.

Its role is not automation, optimization, growth, or efficiency.

Its role is singular:
To translate allowed presence into channel-compatible presence
without intention, interpretation, or internal consequence.

This layer exists so that upload may occur without becoming an act.

What This Is Not
This is not a publishing pipeline
This is not a growth system
This is not a marketing tool
This is not a trigger-based automation
This is not a feedback-aware mechanism
No metrics enter.
No metrics exit.

Core Principle
No adapter knows why it uploads.

Adapters:
do not evaluate
do not schedule
do not react
do not learn
do not optimize
They only pass through when allowance exists.
