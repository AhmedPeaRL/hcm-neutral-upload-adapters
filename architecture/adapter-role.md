The Adapter’s Role

An adapter is a translator, not an actor.

It translates:

• artifact format → platform-acceptable format

• presence state → upload permission

• static metadata → static platform fields

It does not decide:

• when

• where

• why

• how often

Minimal Awareness Model

An adapter may only know:
• A file exists
• The file is marked as allowed
• The channel accepts this file type

Nothing more.
