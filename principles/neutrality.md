Neutrality Definition

Neutrality means:

• No preference between channels

• No prioritization between artifacts

• No sense of success or failure

• No awareness of outcome

Neutrality is preserved by structural ignorance, not discipline.

Structural Ignorance Rules

An adapter must never have access to:

• sales data

• views

• downloads

• user feedback

• revenue signals

• platform analytics

If such data exists, it must remain outside the adapter’s boundary.
