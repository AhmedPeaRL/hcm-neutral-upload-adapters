Supported Channel Philosophy
Adapters may exist for:
Gumroad
Ko-fi
Payhip
Adobe Stock
GitHub Releases / Sponsors
Private Paymob-based surfaces
All channels are treated as equally empty surfaces.
No channel is primary.
No channel is secondary.
Channel Silence Rule
Adapters must never:
adjust content based on channel behavior
change pricing dynamically
alter metadata for performance
Each channel receives the artifact as-is.
