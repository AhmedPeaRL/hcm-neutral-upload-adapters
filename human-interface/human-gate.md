The Human as Gate

The human role is existential, not operational.

Human actions allowed:

• initial account creation

• credential placement

• one-time structural setup

Human actions discouraged:

• performance checking

• result interpretation

• manual prioritization

Why Human Presence Remains

Because:

• complete autonomy is performative

• total removal reintroduces domination elsewhere

The human remains as a non-directive witness.
